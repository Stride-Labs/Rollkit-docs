# How to use Hyperlane token (TIA) as gas token in your rollup

This guide builds upon [CosmWasm rollup](../tutorials/cosmwasm.md), where you set up a local rollup with integrated CosmWasm. In this guide, we will be exploring how to integrate Hyperlane as a safer IBC alterntive for token transfers in your rollup.

## ðŸ’» Deploy the Hyperlane contracts {#deploy-contracts}

Fork the cw-hyperlane repo:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --brnach fix-askQuestion git@github.com:Stride-Labs/cw-hyperlane.git
cd cw-hyperlane
```

This is a temporary fix until [many-things/cw-hyperlane#133](https://github.com/many-things/cw-hyperlane/pull/133) is resolved.

Create `config.yaml` with our networks setup:

```bash
echo 'networks:
  - id: "localwasmd"
    hrp: "wasm"
    endpoint:
      rpc: "http://localhost:36657"
      rest: "http://localhost:1317"
      grpc: "http://localhost:9090"
    gas:
      price: "0.025"
      denom: "uwasm"
    domain: 1063
  - id: "stride-internal-1"
    hrp: "stride"
    endpoint:
      rpc: "https://stride.testnet-1.stridenet.co"
      rest: "https://stride.testnet-1.stridenet.co/api"
      grpc: "http://stride-testnet-grpc.polkachu.com:12290"
    gas:
      price: "0"
      denom: "ustrd"
    domain: 1651

:::tip
The `domain` IDs were generated as a sum or the ascii values of the chain ID, for example:

```python
print(sum(ord(char) for char in "stride-internal-1"))
```

However, you can pick any number as your domain ID.
:::

:::tip
In this guide, we're using a predefined seep phrase for simplicity. Alternativley you can generate and use your own:

```bash
wasmd keys add my-key
```

To get your Stride address, import the generated seed phrase to the `strided` CLI using:

```bash
strided keys add --recover my-key
```

Then fund it using the [Stride testnet faucet](https://stride-faucet.pages.dev).

To get the private key, run:

```bash
wasmd keys export --unsafe --unarmored-hex my-key
```

:::

Config the `wasmd` CLI for ease of use:

```bash
wasmd config set client node tcp://127.0.0.1:36657
wasmd config set client output json
wasmd config set client keyring-backend test
```

Fund the cw-hyperlane signer in our localwasmd rollup:

```bash
wasmd tx bank send localwasm-key wasm133xh839fjn9wxzg6vhc0370lcem8939zr8uu45 10000000uwasm -y --gas-adjustment 1.5 --gas-prices 0.025uwasm
```

:::info
`localwasm-key` is the genesis validator's address. See https://rollkit.dev/cosmwasm/init.sh for more info.
:::

Inside the cw-hyperlane directory, build the Hyperlane contracts:

```bash
yarn install

# Build contracts from local environment
make optimize
# Run compatibility test
make check
```

Upload the contracts:

```bash
# This command will make one file.
# - context with artifacts (default path: {project-root}/context/localwasmd.json)
yarn cw-hpl upload local -n localwasmd
```

Deploy the contracts:

```bash
# This command will output two results.
# - context + deployment    (default path: ./context/osmo-test-5.json)
# - Hyperlane agent-config  (default path: ./context/osmo-test-5.config.json)
yarn cw-hpl deploy -n localwasmd
```
